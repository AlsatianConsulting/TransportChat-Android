Welcome to TransportChat — a LAN-only messenger built for speed and privacy. This first release focuses on dependable local messaging, zero servers, and a clean, dark UI.

Core features

Local-only chat (no internet required): Devices on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot discover each other automatically and exchange messages directly.

End-to-end encryption in transit: Message content is encrypted between participants. No central servers, accounts, or phone numbers.

One-to-one messaging: Timestamps, optional read receipts, and smooth scrolling for long chats.

File & image sharing: Send photos, screenshots, and files across your LAN.

Ephemeral by default: Chats clear when the app closes unless you choose to export.

Quick actions in chat: Rename chat, Export chat, Clear chat, Block user.

Usability

Link support & copy: Tap to open links; long-press a message to copy text.

Smart names: The peers list updates to a contact’s broadcasted name unless you’ve set a nickname. Reset restores the network name.

Dark mode UI: Minimal, high-contrast layout that stays out of your way.

Exports & visibility

Chat export: Save a conversation (and file metadata) to local storage when you need a record.

Transfer status: Clear “file received” / “transfer complete” messages for confidence on large sends.

Privacy & data

No data collection: No analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs.

Local storage only: Any exports or received files are saved on your device under your control.

Permissions (purpose-limited)

Network/Wi-Fi: Discover peers and send/receive messages.

Notifications: Alert you to new messages.

Files/Media (scoped): Attach or save content you choose.

Camera/Microphone (optional): Only used when you attach/record media.

Tips

All devices must be on the same LAN/hotspot. Some “guest” networks block peer-to-peer; use a standard SSID or personal hotspot if peers aren’t visible.

Large file speeds depend on your local network quality
