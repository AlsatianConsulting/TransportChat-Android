TransportChat Android — Privacy Policy (v1.5.2)
Last updated: 2025-03-05

Overview
TransportChat is a LAN-only, peer-to-peer chat and file-transfer app. It does not use any cloud/server component. Messages are kept in memory only and disappear when the app is closed. We do not collect or send any personal data to Alsatian Consulting or third parties.

Data we handle
- Messages: Held in memory during a session only; cleared when you close the app or clear a chat. Not written to persistent storage.
- Files: When you receive a file, it is saved to a location you choose. Sent files leave your device only over the local network to the selected peer(s).
- Display name and port: Stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences.
- Blocklist and nicknames: Stored locally on your device using Android DataStore. These do not leave your device.
- Discovery cache and session labels: Ephemeral, memory-only.
- No accounts, identifiers, analytics, ads, or telemetry are collected or transmitted.

Network and encryption
- The app communicates only on the local network (LAN) using TCP and mDNS/NSD for discovery. It does not contact external servers.
- Sessions use ephemeral key exchange and per-session encryption for messages and file transfers.

Permissions
- INTERNET / ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE / ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: Required for local TCP connections and service discovery.
- CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE: Required to receive multicast DNS for peer discovery.
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+): Used to show incoming message/file notifications; content is sanitized to exclude message previews.

Children
TransportChat is not directed to children under 13. Do not use the app if local laws restrict usage.

Changes to this policy
We may update this policy in the repository or app; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
